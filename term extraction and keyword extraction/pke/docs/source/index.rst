=================

pke is an **open source** python-based **keyphrase extraction** toolkit.

The pke module provides an end-to-end keyphrase extraction pipeline in which
each component can be easily modified or extended to develop new approaches.
pke also allows for easy benchmarking of state-of-the-art keyphrase extraction
approaches, and ships with supervised models trained on the
`SemEval-2010 dataset <http://aclweb.org/anthology/S10-1004>`_.
